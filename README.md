# JFuzzy
* * *

**JFuzzy** is a Java-based fuzzy logic library. It provides a simple, generic framework that enables the application of fuzzy logic. 

## Documentation 

The documentation can be reached at the [wiki page](https://bitbucket.org/sokolovic/jfuzzy/wiki).

# Usage
* * *

To be able to use the library, you can clone the source code from the repository:

```sh
$ git clone https://sokolovic@bitbucket.org/sokolovic/jfuzzy.git
```

You can build a library JAR by running the *Ant* as follows (assuming you're on the same directory level where the ```build.xml``` file resides):

```sh
$ ant
```

After getting the information on successful build, the target JAR is in the ```/build/jar/``` subdirectory of the root project directory.
